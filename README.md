A Simple Ebook downloading bot. 
Much credit to Joel Rosdahl for his irc package:
https://github.com/jaraco/irc
This bot searches irc.irchighway.net only, and is meant only to streamline the somewhat clunky download process. 
This code is of debatable quality, but as far as I can tell, it works.
Use at your own risk

Calling this program:

python3 downloader.py
OR:

python3 downloader.py <nickname> <searchterm>

KNOWN BUGS: If there are no search results, it hangs forever. Sorry.
